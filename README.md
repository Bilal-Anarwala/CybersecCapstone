Capstone Project: Network Redesign for CEDAR

**Overview**
This project was undertaken as my final capstone project during my last year as an undergraduate cybersecurity student at DePaul University. The focus of the project was a comprehensive analysis and redesign of the network infrastructure for a fictional electrical company, CEDAR. The project was completed in a group of 6 people including myself.

**Project Description**
CEDAR's existing network infrastructure was found to be significantly outdated and riddled with security vulnerabilities. My team was assigned the task of:

Assessing the current network infrastructure.
Planning a robust and secure network architecture.
Completely redesigning CEDARâ€™s network to enhance security and efficiency.
Making sure that it adheres to NERC CIP and PCI compliance

**Objectives**
Identify and evaluate the existing security threats within CEDAR's network.
Design a new network infrastructure that addresses these threats.
Implement security measures and best practices in the new network design.
Ensure the new network is scalable and future-proof.
Make sure that it adheres to NERC CIP and PCI compliance

**Contributions**
Conducted a thorough security assessment of the current network.
Collaborated with team members to design a secure and efficient network architecture.
Developed a detailed implementation plan for the new network infrastructure.

**Conclusion**
The redesigned network for CEDAR significantly improves the overall security posture and operational efficiency. This project showcases our ability to assess, plan, and implement a secure network infrastructure in a professional setting.
