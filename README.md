This was my final capstone project during my final year as an undergrad cybersecurity student at DePaul. The project takes a look at a fictional electrical company called CEDAR. 
Their current infrastructure is highly outdated and poses a lot of security threats. 
My group was tasked with assessing, planning, and completely redesigning CEDARâ€™s network design.
